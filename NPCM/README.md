# Using NPC Manager System


## System Overview

The NPC Manager System is for creating NPCs with complex behaviors.

Specifically, NPCs behave can be customized by using NPC Profiles.
NPC Profiles are task lists that NPCs will follow as they go about their daily routines.

Each task can guide the NPC to 
* go to a specific Point of Interest (POI)
* roam inside a volume
* roam between waypoints
* follow a path
* go to a specific location
* go home
In addition, NPCs can be told to do a Custom Task by adding custom logic.
